"""PostToolUse hook -- keep slates-mcp/CLAUDE.md under its cap, automatically.

  CLAUDE.md    2,000 words, pay-to-add ramp at 1,500

Anthropic's memory documentation targets a CLAUDE.md under 200 lines; past that a
file "consumes more context and reduces adherence". This one loads in full, in every
session, before anyone types anything -- and a split alone does not hold it there,
because nothing in the repo objects when the file grows back. This is the objection.

Fires after any Edit/Write to CLAUDE.md and reports, in one pass:

  1. WORD CAP        -- the number above. Above the ramp, every addition is paid for
                        by an equal deletion in the SAME edit.
  2. FOSSILS         -- change-archaeology: "tightened from X", "was 8,000",
                        "previously", "used to be", "changed from", "note: this was".
                        Bare dates are NOT flagged -- invariant headings legitimately
                        carry "(locked YYYY-MM-DD)".
  3. HEDGE PADDING   -- "just to be safe", "it's worth noting", "for what it's worth"
                        and friends: filler that costs every session.

Exit 2 feeds stderr back to the model as actionable feedback WITHOUT blocking the
edit (PostToolUse runs after the write). The model fixes it in the same turn, so Eric
never sees it. Fails open on anything unexpected -- a broken guard must never wedge a
session.
